Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Unzip the zip file. It will create a new directory named "blulens"
   This directory will contain the theme files.
   
2. The config.php file in the blulens directory must be edited to customize
   the template. Edit the file manually or use the online theme customyzer 
   at http://www.glypedesigns.com/customyzer/?t=blulens .
   
3. Upload the blulens directory to your [glype directory]/themes 
   directory. The theme files should now be in 
   [glype directory]/themes/blulens

   
4. If you are using glype version 0.5X then edit your 
   [glype directory]/includes/settings.php file so that the 
   siteSKIN variable is defined like this:
   
   define('siteSKIN','blulens');
   
   If you are using glype version 1.0 then edit your 
   [glype directory]/includes/settings.php file so that the 
   $CONFIG['theme'] variable is assigned the directory name like
   this:
   
   $CONFIG['theme']="blulens";
   

Now if you view your site it should display the new template.
